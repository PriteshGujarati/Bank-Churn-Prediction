# Bank-Churn-Prediction


Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn:

Build a prediction model that will perform the following:

Classify if a customer is going to churn or not
Preferably and based on model performance, choose a model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it easier for customer service to target low hanging fruits in their efforts to prevent churn
